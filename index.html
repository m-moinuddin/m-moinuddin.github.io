        <h1>Education </h1>
		<p>I obtained my PhD in Statistics in 2020 at the University of Padova, Italy. I also got my MS and BSc in the same discipline from the Jahangirnagar University in Bangladesh in 2010 and 2019 respectively. In my PhD research, I have developed a new Divide and Conquer approach which we call "farmer" approach for large spatial data. </p>
