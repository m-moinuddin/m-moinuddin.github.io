This is my project to make statistics easy for all. I salute Swedish Professor Hans Rosling and his style of presenting statistics. Being motivated I set a similar goal of my career as a statistician to make statistics readable and understandable for non-statisticians. In this journey, I will write statistics in an easy language in this blog and also will produce video tutorials freely available on my youtube channel.
